## About

PostConnect is powered by Angular and Angular Material, with a dash of magic from our backend server. Our backend is the result of my best coding attempts, sprinkled with a pinch of self-deprecation and a generous amount of coffee abuse. ☕😄
## Things to Improve

🔧 Adding Unit Tests: Let's ensure our code works like a charm! Let's create robust unit tests to guarantee smooth functionality. 🧪

💅 Enhancing CSS Styles: Time to glam up our platform! Improve CSS styles, make it more visually appealing, and create a captivating user experience. 💄

🐱 Apologize to the Cat: We're sorry, Mr. Whiskers, for making you cry with our silly navbar. We'll make it more purr-fect for you! 😿
